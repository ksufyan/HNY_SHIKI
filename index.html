    <div class="page"> <div class="content">My Love,<br><br>
      I wanted to send this to you as a handwritten letter but unfortunately the visa officers cooked me and now you're off in Lanka and I'm stuck here. Oh well;
      Our first year together (technically) is over and I obviously can't help but ruminate over how much of a whirlwind its literally been. 
      I didn't expect my self to feel the things I felt this year both the high highs and the low lows and I feel like we've definitely been put through the emotional ringer.
       I know, and you know, there were many moments where I wasn't the man I or even you wanted me to be, and I do regret the moments I caused you or exacerbated the stress you were going through. 
       Despite all this I hope you do know I love you immensely. 
      </div> </div>
    <div class="page"> <div class="content">You've obviously faced a lot of your own challenges this year, 
      I won't be rattling them off but I just want you to know that I'm so so proud of you and that despite all the poison I sometimes spit when I'm frustrated or upset 
      (a habit I am genuinely doing my best to get rid of) I truly am grateful for you being in my life the way you were this past year, you were legitimately the only good thing happening to me. 
      I know you're exhausted and tired right now, either of me or in general so I won't ask or need you to reciprocate any of this but
       I just ask that you take my word and believe the things I'm saying to you because I feel like these 10 months are definitely ingrained into me 
       (due to your involvement and due to other things happening) and I don't think its something I could ever forget. 
    </div> </div>
    <div class="page"> <div class="content">Stepping into 2026, I don't know if you believe in us or not, I'm not even going to sit and ask you to. 
      I just want you to know that I am praying and hoping for us to be i. a happier better spot than we were last year, and that I 
      (for my own sake and for ours) will be trying to work much much harder on getting over all my hangups from last year. 
      I want to be there for you inthe capacity you deserve, to cheer you on, to support you, to care for you and to show you the kind of deep love I know and I hope you know I can give you. 
    </div> </div>
    <div class="page"> <div class="content">I'm truly hoping this year brings us closer together and brings us more joy, 
      laughter and most importantly triumphs (lol). 
      This is all just a long winded way of saying I really truly adore you and love you more than I've actually been able to show and more than I think you understand.
    </div> </div>
    <div class="page"> <div class="content">Somehow after all this, as the delusional optimist I am I'm still excited for 2026, and I'm still kind of proud of nothing else ever working out (if you remember the song this is referencing you get brownie points). I genuinely can't wait.<br><br>

      Happy New Year Sita, I love you.<br><br>
      
      Forever yours,<br><br>
      6am Sufyan.
